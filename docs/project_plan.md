# Project Plan: Cashless Casino Frontend (Updated 2026-07-22)

## Key Design Principles

1. **Every interaction should feel alive** — buttons squish, lists bounce, numbers roll up.
2. **Wins deserve a celebration** — big wins get full-screen overlays; small wins get subtle sparkles.  
3. **Anticipation builds engagement** — spinning reels with staggered stops, roulette ball orbiting longer before dropping.
4. **Near-misses are teasing, not frustrating** — show a "so close!" animation that encourages one more spin.
5. **Ambient motion keeps the page alive** — particles, glows, shimmer sweeps; always subtle enough to ignore.
